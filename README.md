# procedurally-generated-maze-game
A game I made in Python that randomly generates progressively harder maze levels using Wilson's algorithm. There is save file implementation.

Keep all python files and the image file in the same base folder. Put the save.txt files in a folder within the base folder named 'saves'. To play the game, run the maze_game.py file. You can create a shortcut to that file outside of the base file for easy access.
